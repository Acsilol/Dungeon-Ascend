# Dungeon Ascend

Dungeon Ascend is a 2.5D isometric rogue-like dungeon crawler built in Unity. In this game, you play as a hero fighting your way through randomly generated dungeons, facing enemies, and collecting loot to survive. The game features WASD movement and mouse-based aiming for combat.

This project is primarily made for my University Thesis but also a great opportunity to enchance my Unity skills.

- **Mouse Aiming**: Aim and attack enemies with using the mouse.
- **Melee Combat**: Use a sword for close-range combat.
- **Enemy AI**: Fight against enemies with basic attack patterns.
- **Health & Damage System**: Manage your health while battling enemies.
