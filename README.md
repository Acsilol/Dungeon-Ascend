# Dungeon Ascend

Dungeon Ascend is a 2.5D isometric rogue-like dungeon crawler built in Unity. In this game, you play as a hero fighting your way through randomly generated dungeons, facing enemies, and collecting loot to survive. The game features WASD movement and mouse-based aiming for combat.

This project is primarily made for my University Thesis but also a great opportunity to enchance my Unity skills.
